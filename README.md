# Public Transit Reliability and Open Fare Accounting

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for transparent transit performance metrics with service SLAs, disruptions, and fare revenue allocation.

## Overview

The Public Transit Reliability and Open Fare Accounting system leverages smart contracts to provide unprecedented transparency in public transit operations. This system tracks service reliability, manages fare accounting, and ensures accountability through blockchain-based service level agreements (SLAs).

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of two primary smart contracts:

1. **Route Schedule and GTFS Attestation Contract** (`route-schedule-and-gtfs-attestation`)
   - Publishes signed GTFS schedules and route changes
   - Maintains versioned histories of all schedule modifications
   - Provides cryptographic attestation of route data integrity

2. **Real-time Arrival and Dwell Aggregation Contract** (`real-time-arrival-and-dwell-aggregation`)
   - Aggregates Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data
   - Calculates headway adherence metrics
   - Tracks dwell times and on-time performance scores
   - Monitors service disruptions and SLA compliance

## Key Features

### Service Reliability Tracking
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of vehicle locations and arrival times
- **Headway Adherence**: Measurement of schedule compliance and service frequency
- **Dwell Time Analysis**: Monitoring of station stop durations and passenger boarding efficiency
- **On-time Performance**: Comprehensive scoring system for punctuality metrics

### Service Level Agreement (SLA) Management
- **Automated SLA Monitoring**: Smart contract-based tracking of service commitments
- **Rider Credit System**: Automatic compensation for service failures
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Proactive notification system for service degradation

### Accessibility and Transparency
- **Elevator Outage Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of accessibility infrastructure
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated ADA and accessibility standard verification
- **Rider Feedback Integration**: Verified community reporting and feedback system

### Fare Revenue Transparency
- **Open Fare Accounting**: Transparent tracking of fare collection and revenue
- **Revenue Allocation**: Clear documentation of fund distribution
- **Performance-based Budgeting**: Linking service quality to resource allocation

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
- Built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contract language
- Immutable record keeping for all transit data
- Cryptographic verification of data integrity
- Decentralized governance for system parameters

### Data Sources
- **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)**: Industry-standard transit schedules
- **AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location)**: Real-time vehicle positioning data
- **AFC (Automatic Fare Collection)**: Passenger boarding and fare payment data
- **CAD/AVL Systems**: Computer-Aided Dispatch and vehicle monitoring

### Security Features
- **Data Attestation**: Cryptographic signatures for data authenticity
- **Immutable History**: Blockchain-based audit trail
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for data submission
- **Validation Logic**: Smart contract-enforced data quality checks

## Use Cases

### For Transit Agencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven insights for service improvements
- **Budget Justification**: Transparent metrics for funding requests
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated reporting for transit authorities
- **Service Planning**: Historical data analysis for route optimization

### for Riders
- **Service Reliability**: Real-time and historical performance data
- **Compensation Claims**: Automatic SLA credit processing
- **Service Feedback**: Community-driven reporting and verification
- **Accessibility Information**: Current status of accessibility features

### For Stakeholders
- **Transparency**: Open access to transit performance metrics
- **Accountability**: Verifiable service commitments and outcomes
- **Data Integrity**: Blockchain-verified transit information
- **Economic Impact**: Clear visualization of fare revenue utilization

## Contract Interactions

### Route Schedule Management
```clarity
;; Example: Publishing a new GTFS schedule
(contract-call? .route-schedule-and-gtfs-attestation publish-schedule
  schedule-data
  version-number
  signature)
```

### Performance Data Recording
```clarity
;; Example: Recording arrival time data
(contract-call? .real-time-arrival-and-dwell-aggregation record-arrival
  route-id
  stop-id
  vehicle-id
  timestamp
  scheduled-time)
```

## Benefits

### Operational Benefits
